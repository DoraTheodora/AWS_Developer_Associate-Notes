### Description
The notes are updated as I follow the course, and are <b>my own interpretation</b> of the course. 

The course can be found at https://t.co/D0A0OTJHF3?amp=1, and the cost of the course is <b>approximatelly</b> 50 dollars. The course is magnificent, and I enourage anyone who wants to get certified in AWS to follow Adrian's courses.
